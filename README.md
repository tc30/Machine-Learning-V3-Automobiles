# Machine-Learning-V3-Automobiles

This is a Jupyter notebook which contains a Machine Learning project created by Tom Cavey. The purpose of this project is to allow a user to provide a photo of a car (limited to 54 specific manufacturers) and using Google's Inception V3 pre-trained neural netowrk, the type of car will be chosen.
